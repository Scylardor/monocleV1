// CaptureWritePolicy is a logging write-policy that captures its input by simply appending it to a string.
// Mainly useful to check what you received.

// TODO: GetCapturedOutput API isn't super clean because we can't export std::string in a DLL because of potential ABI problems
// cf. this warning:
// warning C4251: 'moe::CaptureWritePolicy::m_captured': class 'std::basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char>>' needs to have dll-interface to be used by clients of class 'moe::CaptureWritePolicy'
// it should be OK if we build linking exe and linked DLL with the same compiler, but ultimately we can't use std for this.
